""Superstore Sales Analysis & Forecasting""

-Project Overview
    This project presents an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning workflow built on a retail Superstore sales dataset. The objective was to clean and analyze transactional sales data, build an interactive business dashboard, and apply a lightweight machine learning model to forecast future sales trends.

    The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a data project — from raw data handling to insights, visualization, and predictive modeling.

-Dataset
    Source: Kaggle – Superstore Sales Dataset
    Type: Transactional retail sales data
    Granularity: Order-level data aggregated to monthly level for forecasting

-Tools & Technologies
    Python
        pandas
        numpy
        matplotlib
        seaborn
        scikit-learn
    Power BI (Dashboard & Visualization)
    Jupyter Notebook
    Git & GitHub

-Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
    Converted date columns to datetime format
    Handled missing values and verified data consistency
    Engineered time-based features (Year, Month, Year-Month)
    Performed sanity checks on sales values and date ranges
    Aggregated transactional data into monthly sales for modeling

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Analyzed overall sales distribution
    Identified monthly sales trends
    Compared sales performance across product categories and regions
    Derived insights useful for business decision-making

-Power BI Dashboard
    An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
        Total Sales (KPI)
        Monthly Sales Trend
        Sales by Category
        Sales by Region
    Dynamic slicers allow filtering by:
        Year
        Category
        Region
    The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore trends and performance interactively.

-Machine Learning: Sales Forecasting
    A lightweight forecasting model was implemented to predict monthly sales.
        Approach
            Aggregated sales data at monthly level
            Created lag-based features (previous 1–3 months sales)
            Performed time-aware train-test split (80–20)
            Trained a Linear Regression model
            Evaluated using MAE and RMSE
            Visualized actual vs predicted sales
            Saved the trained model for reuse
    This approach emphasizes correctness, interpretability, and real-world applicability.

-Key Learnings
    Importance of proper data cleaning and sanity checks
    Feature engineering for time-series data
    Difference between descriptive analytics and predictive modeling
    Building dashboards that communicate insights clearly
    End-to-end ownership of a data project
